			Iris is the key ingredient of the perfume, surrounded by orange blossoms and jasmine in the heart. 
			The compositions opening provides fruity flavour of black currant and pear, while the base is warm, 
			gourmand and powdery due to almond-like accords of tonka bean, praline, patchouli and vanilla.
